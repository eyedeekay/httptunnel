      On Unixes, always run it with the flag -littleboss=start to ensure that the
      proxy always re-starts itself.

    <p>
      This is a very simple standalone HTTP Proxy for I2P based on the SAM Bridge. It
      has a few advantages in certain situations, especially for adapting applications
      that speak HTTP to the I2P network. It allows applications to start their own
      HTTP proxies, with their own identities within I2P and their own discrete
      configurations. It also has some disadvantages, it cannot add new readable
      names to your I2P address book nor is it able to use an outproxy. It’s new, but
      it should be stable enough to experiment with a Tor Browser or a hardened
      Firefox configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, and is not intended to be, and will not be intended for use by
      multiple clients at the same time. It might be more-or-less OK as part of an
      inproxy but you should only use it for one client at a time. A multi-client
      solution will also be available soon(
      <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/eeProxy" rel="nofollow">
        eeProxy
      </a>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not something you should use without understanding. It is also not
      terribly hard to understand. It runs two services. One is an HTTP proxy that
      uses the SAM API to retrieve information from I2P. The other is a controller
      for that http proxy which, for now, only has one function that re-starts it
      entirely. Doing this closes your SAM connection and your existing tunnels,
      guaranteeing that you browse new sites with a fresh identity. The reset function
      on UNIX-Like operating systems can optionally re-set an application’s
      configuration back to the state it was in when the proxy was started.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is useful because I2P tunnel identities can be tracked across eepSites
      during contemporary visits, and when combined with a long-term identifier like
      a user account, can become “Retroactively Linkable.” This enables an
      easy-to-use, user-controlled interface for manually creating a new identity
      before and after logging into an eepSite with a user account. An example
      application which uses this is
      <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/i2psetproxy.js" rel="nofollow">
        i2psetproxy.js
      </a>
      a WebExtension which assures I2P Proxy settings and provides a “Reset Identity”
      button on the Firefox toolbar.
